# renderer-ray-trace

A Rust implementation of a software ray tracer, implemented following the
tutorial [Ray Tracing in a Weekend](https://www.realtimerendering.com/raytracing/Ray%20Tracing%20in%20a%20Weekend.pdf).
Also added some influences from [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://misterdanb.github.io/raytracinginrust/).
